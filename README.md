## Android Components Examples

## Activities and Intent
For Activities and Intent we have two examples:
- *TwoActivities*: This example shows how two activities can interact between them using explicit intents and also it shows how to return a result from an Activity to another.

- *ImplicitIntent*: This example shows how an Activity can use an implicit intent to open another application that can perform a required action.

## BroadcastReceiver
For Broadcast Receiver we have an example that notice when the screen is turn on and shows a message with the time for that action.
